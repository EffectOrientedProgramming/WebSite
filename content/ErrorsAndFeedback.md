## Errors in the Book and Examples (Not the Exercises)

Please check the [Issues](https://github.com/BruceEckel/AtomicKotlinExamples/issues)
to see if your error has already been reported.

Please report all errors in the book's prose *or* in its examples as
***issues*** in the [Atomic Kotlin Examples Github Repository](https://github.com/BruceEckel/AtomicKotlinExamples/issues).

## Errors in the Exercises (The Course)

If you have any problems setting up and running the course (aka the exercises), please read [The
Troubleshooting Guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/troubleshooting-guide.html).
If that doesn't solve your problem, please contact the support team as mentioned
in the guide.

Please report errors in either the exercise descriptions or in the exercise solutions via the JetBrains issue tracker, using
[This Prefilled Form](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=EDC&summary=AtomicKotlin%3A%20%3C%3C%20atom%20%2B%20exercise%20%3E%3E&description=%3C%3C%20Describe%20the%20problem%20here%20%3E%3E&c=Subsystem%20Kotlin&c=Assignee%20svtk).
Note that you'll need to log in into YouTrack. Thank you!
